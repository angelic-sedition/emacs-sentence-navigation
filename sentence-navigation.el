;;; sentence-navigation.el --- Commands to navigate one-spaced sentences.

;; Author: Lit Wakefield <nocturnal.artifice@gmail.com>
;; URL: https://github.com/angelic-sedition/emacs-sentence-navigation
;; Keywords: sentence evil
;; Package-Requires: ((cl-lib "0.5"))
;; Version: 0.1

;;; Commentary:
;; This package gives commands for sentence navigation and manipulation
;; that ignore abbreviations. For example, in a sentence that contains
;; "Mr. MacGyver", "MacGyver" will not be considered to be the start of
;; a sentence. One-spaced sentences are the target of this plugin, but
;; it will also work properly with two-spaced sentences.

;; This package is inspired by vim-textobj-sentence and uses a modified
;; version of its default regex list. Evil is an optional dependency
;; that is used for the text objects this package provides.

;; For more information see the README in the github repo.
